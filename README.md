## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)

-An idea that I would add for this website project would be the ability to check on your wait time when you set a reservation.

-Another idea that I had while I was making this project was "what if the coffeeshop had its own little livestream and was just broadcasting whatever genre of music they were currently playing at the coffeeshop. And the person on the website had the ability to tune into said livestream by going to the website and playing the music player from wherever there at in the world so they feel like there in a coffeeshop no matter where there at in the word.

-Directions on how to get there (I get that this is just a project but that would be really cool to see) and also get to see what the weather is like to get the best time to go to the coffeeshop. And so its all right there on one website and you don't have to bounce around everywhere to have to find the important information. It's all just right there at your convenience.

-A way to order ahead would be great and you could order from the website and by the time you got there you could just pick up and your drink and just sit down.
